# DIY-user

**!WIP!**

User management solution for Symfony 5.2. Includes new Authenticator login, remember me, forgot password + reset, confirmation email.

Note that this is a personal practice project intended to learn the Symfony 5.2 security changes and play with some ideas. It is not a finished bundle and should not be used by anyone. It is an example implementation.

To do:
* Admin user CRUD
* Fix the UserChecker for unconfirmed or disabled accounts
